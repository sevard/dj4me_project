                                        I created this website to showcase my projects in one convenient location
                                        and to highlight my skills. In addition, I will post some usefull
                                        information for those who are interested in web-development and testing.
                                        I'm passionate about software development, and I'm truly amazed by how the
                                        internet connects people worldwide.
                                        It's easy to take for granted, but there's a rich history behind it,
                                        and it took the collective effort of countless engineers to make it as seamless
                                        as it is today.

               I created this website to showcase my projects in one convenient location 
            and to highlight my skills. In addition, I will post some usefull
            information to people who are interested in web-development and testing.
            I'm passionate about software development, and I'm truly amazed by how the internet connects people worldwide. 
            It's easy to take for granted, but there's a rich history behind it, 
            and it took the collective effort of countless engineers to make it as seamless as it is today.

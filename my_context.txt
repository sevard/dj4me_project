                        <h3>Why is this web-site?</h3>
                        <p>
                            When we hear the word 'software', the very first thing that comes to mind is cell phones, laptops, or possibly
                            smart watches, I am guessing less frequently headphones... 
                            If you look around and think carefully, you'll see that software surround us everywhere!
                            Traffic lights, automatic doors, ATM machines, credit card readers at your local grocery store, 
                            car keys, there are even light bulbs that have software in it. 
                            ...<br>
                            Before a product that was manufactured can be used by people, let's say a car, it needs to be tested! 
                            Various types of testing needs to be done so that when we, people, use it, it satisfies our needs and expectations! 
                            No one wants to drive a car that is not safe or unexpectedly breaks in the middle of a road.
                            Software is not exception. It needs to be tested so that it is safe to use and does what it supposed to do.
                            <br>....<br>
                            All that software is developed by people, and therefor human phsychology is involved.
                            Testing software requires a mindset that differs from a software engineer's mindset. 
                            
                            <br>....<br>
                            All that software is developed by people, and therefor human phsychology is involved.
                            <br>....<br>
                            People are often curious how thigns that surround us are built and how they work behind the scenes. 
                            We sometimes even 
                            not work as we would expect!
                            So curiousity and attention to details brought me to the field of testig.
                            Then I was curious how does it feel like being a developer?
                            So here I am with the web-site! It runs on Python Django framework and bult with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and other technologies. 
                            Development and testing software is a complex field of study, but if we apply patience and do it with fun it becomes much easier! 
                            I learn and apply the skills in my day to day job, so I hope the information you will find on the web-site will be usefull for you too.
                            This web-site is to share knowledge and help those who are also interested in software development and testing,
                            to find some usefull information.

                            Anyone who likes to build, test, share with others' and have fun with their product.
                            Those who probably want to learn more about software development or is in general curious
                            about
                            how
                            things
                            work behind the scenes. Perhaps anyone who is interested in learing Python, HTML, CSS,
                            JavaScript,
                            GNU/Linux, Unix, Git
                            or tools for automating tests at Component, Integration or System Test levels.
